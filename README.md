# city-music-project
Use data to test the hypotheses of music preferences and compare user behavior between two cities: Springfield and Shelbyville.

## Project Description
Whenever we're performing analysis, we need to formulate hypotheses that we can then test. Sometimes we accept these hypotheses; other times, we reject them. To make the right decisions, a business must be able to understand whether or not it's making the right assumptions. 
In this project, we'll compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville and look at the real data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.

## Hypotheses
1.	User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
2.	On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
3.	Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.

## Description of the data
-	'userID' — user identifier
-	'Track' — track title
-	'artist' — artist's name
-	'genre'
-	'City' — user's city
